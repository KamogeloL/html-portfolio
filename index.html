 <h1>Kamogelo's Portfolio</h1>
 <h2>I am budding Web Developer</h2>
 <p>I currently have 2 projects under my belt as a result of a Web Development BootCamp. </p>
 <p>These projects are basic webpages that showcase how far in the bootcamp I am.</p>
 <hr />
 <h3><a href="./public/movie-ranking.html">Movie Ranking Project</a></h3><br />
 <img src="./assets/images/movie-ranking.png" alt="Movie Ranking Project Webpage" />
 <p>This project was all about learning how to use the elements of html we just went through. The project was quite easy. At this point we had learnt about the heading elements which go up till 6, the paragraph element as well has the void elements hence the use of the horizontal rule element. Please click the link above to see the webpage.</p>

 <h3><a href="./public/birthday-invite.html">Birthday Invite Project</a></h3><br />
 <img src="./assets/images/birthday-invite.png" alt="Birthday Invite Project Webpage"  />
 <p>This project was a small step up from the one above. By this point we had learnt how to create list, nesting and indentation, the use of anchor elements as well as an introduction to the image element. Please click the link above to see the webpage.</p>
